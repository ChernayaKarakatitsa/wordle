# wordle
I made wordle in Python. Give it a go.

This is my first public repo and I have no formal cs education, so please forgive any sins I commit.

Included are three files, a .py, a .ipynb, and a .txt
Download all three, the python file and jupyter notebook give two slightly different user experiences.

I haven't quite ironed out all the filepath issues with the two files, so you might have to do some edits to those after downloading. If you run into any issues, make sure your working directory is all sorted out and edit filepaths as necessary.

Otherwise, call the wordle() function in its own code cell in the jupyter notebook to play, or run the entire .py file to play via the terminal. The game will give you instructions. Enjoy!
